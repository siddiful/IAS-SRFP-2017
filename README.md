I have implemented, analysed and compared various space efficient methods for finding the solutions of dense algebraic linear equations that may contain very large no. of variables. These methods had only been proposed in research papers and their executable c/c++ implementation (both sequential and parallelized) can be found here. The analysis of these methods (performed by me) can be found in REPORTS sub-repository. Please see the INDEX for the details of each code.
